## What describes this repository?

This repository describes the envrionment build for VP18.
VP18 runs a hardware environment in a colocation located at [JH Computers](https://jh-computers.de/).

The main goals of this environment are:

* Provide a network testing lab for:
  * Switch/network automation
  * Sonic packaging
  * Evaluating network concepts
* Run a "production-like" experimentation and testing plattform
  * testing of new releases
  * reproduce and analyze production problems on a real system
  * develop and test topics that can only be analyzed, tested or reproduced on a real system
  * demonstration showroom for interested parties
  * dogfooding / continuous operation with real workload
  * develop operational procdures
  * develop and test certification tests
  * ...
