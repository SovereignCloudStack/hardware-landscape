    # FIXME: Api requires `assigned_object_type` and `assigned_object_id`
    # to assign ip address to the resource, e.g. device.
    # This workaround facilitates the import based on device name and interface name.
    # The same approach is used in the UI import form.
    # The above needs a "special" handling in the code and would be nice to introduce a
    # general approach.
