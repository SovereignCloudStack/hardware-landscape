# Colocation Info and Contact

## Location

The setup is physically located at ScaleUp's Berlin-Mahlsdorf (BER3) site. The Rack is refered as `BER3.H3.H.01.1`.

## Contact

The ScaleUp Team can offer "Remote Hands" for tasks that require physical access to the machines (e.g. rebooting a crashed switch). Any requested work may be charged to the OSBA e.V.

As this is a non critical setup, there is no 24/7 on-call support available.
