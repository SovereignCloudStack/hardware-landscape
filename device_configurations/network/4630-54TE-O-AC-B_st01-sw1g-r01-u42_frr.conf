! ===================== Auto-generated configuration. Do not edit manually! =====================
! This configuration is auto-generated from config_db.json using integrated FRR configuration, managed by either the bgpcfgd 
! or the newer frrcfgd daemon. It is enabled through the `docker_routing_config_mode` in the DEVICE_METADATA table.
! The `docker_routing_config_mode` determines how the integrated FRR configuration is applied:
! - `separated`: Generates FRR configuration from ConfigDB, with each FRR daemon having its own configuration file.
! - `unified`: Generates a single FRR configuration file from ConfigDB, shared across all FRR daemons.
! To confirm the use of the frrcfgd daemon, check the `frr_mgmt_framework_config` field in the DEVICE_METADATA table.
! It should be set to `true`.
!
! This configuration serves as a backup and is not intended as the primary source for restoring FRR configuration.
! For restoring FRR configurations with integrated FRR setup, use config_db.json.
