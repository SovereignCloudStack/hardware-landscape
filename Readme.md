## What describes this repository?

This repository describes the envrionment build for VP18.
VP18 runs a hardware environment in a colocation located at [JH Computers](https://jh-computers.de/).

The main goals of this environment are:

* Provide a network testing lab for:
  * Switch/network automation
  * Sonic packaging
  * Evaluating network architecture concepts
  * Test environment to evaluate and test concepts and implementations in layer-3 underlay networking with SONiC
  * Test environment to evaluate and test improvements to the monitoring stack
* Run a "production-like" experimentation and testing plattform
  * Demonstration showroom for interested parties
    (A blueprint for potential SCS operators to get an idea of the OSISM setup)
  * Training and demonstration environment
  * Testing of new releases
    (Environment for the future execution of QA tests)
  * Reproduce and analyze production problems on a real system
  * Develop and test topics that can only be analyzed, tested or reproduced on a real system
  * Dogfooding / continuous operation with real workload
  * Develop operational procdures
  * Develop and test certification tests
